Approach #1
    doubleL(n)
        - it doubles the each time it loops ranging from 1 to n and put them in a list and return the list

Approach #2
    -the loop will itterate for each number from 0-4 and each number that results from it will be doubled and printed

Approach #3
    - doubleG(n) will loop from 0-n and return a generator that doubles each i in the loop
